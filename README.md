ThreeCircles: step by step tutorial
--------------------------
This github repository holds all the step by step tutorial to illustrate how to use 
[3musket33rs](http://3musket33rs.github.com/) html5-mobile-scaffolding Grails plugin. 

Do you want to see step by step how to build a single page web app? This workshop was presented at [ConFESS](https://2013.con-fess.com/) and [Gr8Conf US] (http://gr8conf.us/Presentations/Mobile-App-in-minutes--not-day)
with the following abstract:

***Hybrid Mobile App in minutes not days***

*Can you build your own version of Foursquare in minutes? Yes, you can.*
*To survive offline your presentation logic should reside on the client. Using HTML5 power and jQuery mobile responsive UI your web app becomes Mobile.*
*Ready to take the mobile challenges: geolocation, offline caching, data synchronization, server side event push, camera and packaging as Hybrid using PhoneGap.*
*At the end of the session, you will have a clone of Foursquare on your mobile, with a REST backend in Grails running on the cloud. All that with one goal in mind: have fun!* 

You will find associated presentation at [http://corinnekrych.github.com/confess/](http://corinnekrych.github.com/confess/)

## Setup
### GitHub Repos
Fork or clone this repo but also the 3musket33rs plugins
```java
git clone https://github.com/3musket33rs/html5-mobile-scaffolding
git clone https://github.com/fabricematrat/ThreeCircles.git
```
You will need also grails 2.2.3, jdk1.7, a modern browser (no IE6!)

### Working with branches
The step by step tutorial works with git branches. For each step you will find a branch **stepXX_todo** and **stepXX_done**
Here will be the list of git commands you will need to know
```java
git checkout stepXX_todo // To enter in the stepXX_todo branch
git branch               // to check in which branch you are
git status               // to know which files you modified in the current branch
git add -A               // to add files to be committed
git commit -m "Some usefull comments" //To commit locally your changes
git pull                 // to fetch the latest changes from the remote repo
git push                 // to send your committed changes to the remote repo if you did a fork
```

## Step1: Scaffolding

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step1_todo
```
### 2. We've DONE it for you
#### 2.1 Create app
In this branch, we have created a Grails app ThreeCircles with this command
```java
grails create-app ThreeCircles
```

#### 2.2 Configure app
Now let's start looking at the configuration added

In BuildConfig.groovy
```java
  grails.plugin.location."html5-mobile-scaffolding" = "../html5-mobile-scaffolding"
```
to get the latest from source code.

in plugins section
```java
    plugins {
        runtime ":hibernate:$grailsVersion"
        runtime ":jquery:1.9.1"
        build ":tomcat:$grailsVersion"
        compile ":webxml:1.4.1"
    }
```
in resolution **legacyResolve** has been changed
```java
    grails.project.dependency.resolution = {    
    ....
        legacyResolve true
    ...
    }
```
to fetch Platform Core plugins.

in UrlMappings.groovy
line removed
```java
    "/"(view:"/index")
```

#### 2.3 Comain classes
We've added the following domain classes. Look at the class diagram
![class diagram](https://github.com/fabricematrat/ThreeCircles/raw/master/imagesTutorial/classDiagram.png "class diagram")

### 3. Your TODO
This is where you start doing some work!

#### 3.1 Generate HTML5 scaffolding
for both controller and views using 3musketeers plugin script

```java
grails html-generate-all threecircles.User
grails html-generate-all threecircles.Place
grails html-generate-all threecircles.Comment
grails html-generate-all threecircles.Checkin
```
#### 3.2 Run the app
```java
grails run-app
```

#### 3.3 Go to URL
```java
http://localhost:8080/ThreeCircles/index.html?_debugResources=y
```
Note: adding _debugResources=y to reload JavaScript/CSS/HTML updates for resources plugins

### 4. Get source code from repo
Before you get the solution push your changes
```java
git status                   // to check the list of files changed or added
git add -A                   // to accept all changes
git commit -m "your changes" // to commit to local repo
git push                     // to push to remote repo if you did fork
```
and if you want to check the solution
```java
git checkout step1_done
```
## Step2: Boostrap
### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step2_todo
```

### 2. We've DONE it for you
Search for TODO in grails-app/conf/Bootstrap.groovy

### 3. Your TODO 

#### 3.1 In BootStrap.groovy
- add several users
- add some places with coordinate. Choose your favorite places like:

```java
        Place minneapolis = new Place(name: "Minneapolis Convention Center",
                latitude: 44.96930003941189,
                longitude: -93.27280524253842,
                address:  "1301 2nd avenue S, MN55403" )
        minneapolis.save()
```
- add a checkin at Gr8Conf!

#### 3.2 Run the app
```java
grails run-app
```
- Test the application
- Try with offline mode (in chrome switch off network, in Firefox File-> Work Offline)
- Add/Delete Users for example
- Get back online

### 4. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step2_done
```

## Step3: Render timeline with mock picture

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step3_todo
```
### 2. We've DONE it for you

you will get new folders and files containing mock screen for timeline
- added new cool CSS in web-app/css/my.css
- and images in web-app/img/
- delete index.html, this default page listing all controller available in Grails. 
- rename checkin-index.html into index.html. Checkin will become our main view with a timeline of all checkins
- in index.html, section with id **section-list-checkin** revisit footer 

### 3. Your TODO 
Search for TODO in the project

#### 3.1 Transform your index.html with css
- in index.html (search "TODO header"), in section with id **section-list-checkin** add cool header using jQuery Mobile

#### 3.2 Display dynamic content
The js file **web-app/js/threecircles/checkin-view.js** contains the JavaScript associated with your view. 
Let's make the content dynamic!
In index.html (search "TODO render timeline"):

1. remove hard coded string'Gr8Conf US in Minneapolis' by dynamic value coming from element
To help you know what JSON is returned by Controller server side, put a break point in your browser in this method and inspect element.
2. remove hard coded value for 'Corinne Krych' by value coming from element etc...
3. loop for all checkins
Leave harcoded place holder for pictures.

### 4. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step3_done
```

## Step4: Get timeline with time information

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step4_todo
```
### 2. We've DONE it for you
You will get a new file timeline.js that you will complete for the time information.

### 3. Your TODO
#### 3.1 Add JS file timeline.js
- go to timeline.js
Note 3musket33rs JS coding Ã  la Crockford (function first!).
Add a method which takes a Date as long and returns information like:
*just now* (when under 10mins), *11 min ago*, *2h23 min*, *2 days ago*, *3 months ago* and we don't care when it's over one year.
- go to checkin-view.js (search for //TODO) add call to newly created method to add time information.
- go to index.html to include new js file

### 4. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step4_done
```

## Step5: Google places

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step5_todo
```
### 2. We've DONE it for you
- you will get a new file geolocation.js that you will complete.
- in index.html, google API  and geolocation.js has been included
- in index.html, section with id "section-show-checkin" has been refactored to apply CSS and match our use case. 
- in checkin-view.js, we initialized our maps with
- in geolocation.js, a google map is created from canvas from canvas id
Using Google API: [google.maps.Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Map)

```java
    $("#section-show-checkin").on( "pageshow", function (event) {
        geolocationSearch.showMapWithPlaces('map_canvas2', "list-place", storeLatLng);
    });
```
### 3. Your TODO
In geolocation.js, seach "TODO search places". The goal of this step is
to make you discover useful Google services when doing feolocation stuff.
Once navigator got our current position with HTML5 **navigator.geolocation**, use google places API
#### 3.1 TODO 1: initialise google places service
See API documentation
Use Google places API: [google.maps.places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#PlacesService)
#### 3.2 TODO 2: In PlacesService find the places close by with all details
#### 3.3 TODO 3: In search callback method, calculate the distance between you current
location and the point of interest
Use Google geometry API: [google.maps.geometry.spherical](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#spherical)
#### 3.4 TODO 4: Create a marker and add it to the map
Use Google Marker API: [google.maps.Marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker)

Use Google position API: [google.maps.LatLng](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#LatLng)

### 4. Get source code from repo

```java
git checkout step5_done
```
## Step6: Checkin!

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step6_todo
```
### 2. We've DONE it for you
- In index.html, section with id **checkin** has been refactored to apply CSS and match our use case
- In checkin-view.js, we initialize on pageshow jqm event our third map **map_canvas3** with

```java
    $("#checkin").on( "pageshow", function (event) {
        geolocationCheckin.showMap('map_canvas3', that.selectedPlace);
    });
```
- In checkin-view.js, **addAndSort** method added to render timeline with latest checkin first.
- In geolocation.js, use [google info window](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#InfoWindow) to render bubble.

### 3. Your TODO
#### 3.1 TODO 1: Add behaviour when click on checkin button
In checkin-view.js, search TODO 1
- format the object before sending

```java
            {
               checkin: "{
                  description: description,
                  'owner.id': "1",
                   place: placeObj,
                  when: new Date().getTime()
               }"
           }
```

#### 3.2 TODO 2: Save place server side
In CheckinController.groovy, search TODO 2
Once a place is found with Google Places, save it to ThreeCircles database.
Look at **event** method that triggers the event push (we'll use event push next step on view)

#### 3.2 TODO 3: Visualize data in time line
On created, in checkin-view.js, deal with event push. 

Let's test event push. To simulate 2 users open 2 different browsers (Chrome and Firefox for example, it has to be 2 different instance of browsers).

- In Chrome, click on "check in" button on footer. 
- Same in Firefox, click on "check in" button.
- in chrome select a place, add a description and checkin
- notice how Firefox get notified

Event push (Grails plugin using Atmosphere framework) is doing broadcast to all browsers.  
3musket33rs PushManager is dealing with excluding "myself".

In order to know in your code if you're the one triggering 
created callback you can user the NOTIFIED tag. NOTIFIED boolean is set true when you are notidied of somebody else event.
In **that.model.createdItem** callback change page only when needed.

### 4. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step6_done
```

## Step7: Let's take a picture

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step7_todo
```
### 2. We've DONE it for you

### 3. Your TODO
#### 3.1 TODO 1: Add a new attribute in domain class
In Checkin.groovy, by convention every attribute of type **byte[]** is considerered as a photo. Create one field called photo
No need to re-generate scaffolded view: be carefull not to loose all your work on checkin view!

#### 3.2 TODO 2: Photo should be optional. 
See how to add to define 
[constraints](http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Constraints/Usage.html) in Grails.
Photo should have size of 20Mb

#### 3.3 TODO 3: add input for photo
In geolocation.js, in the bubble window, add an input of type **file** with id **input-checkin-photo**

#### 3.4 TODO 4: take picture polyfill
In geolocation.js, use 3musketeers plugin camera service in grails.mobile.camera to take the picture and display it.

#### 3.5 TODO 5: Retrieve photo from input
In checkin-view.js, on **checkin-submit** uncomment line.

#### 3.6 TODO 6: Display picture on timeline
In checkin-view.js, modify **createListItemCustom** to display picture if present

### 4. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step7_done
```

## Step8: Put all together
This step ** does not ** have a TO DO section.

You can rest a bit ;-)

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step8_done
```
### 2. We've DONE it for you

Here is what was done for you:

- in checkin-view.js, generated code has been cleaned to leave only what's needed
- place-index.html & user-index.html has been merge in a single page index.html
- place-view.js & user-view.js has been cleaned. 

### 3. Your TODO
Nothing! just test it to see where we are...

## Step9: Spring Security for login

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step9_todo
```

### 2. We've DONE it for you
You will get:
- in BuildConfig.groovy, Spring Security dependency was added
- in **index.html** a new section with id **login-page** has been added for the login form.
- in **checkin-view.js**, login\logout methods and callbacks have been implemented.
- **checkin-model.js** and **checkin-controller.js** new files. If you want to know more on those two files read note below.

```java
**NOTE: ** 3musket33rs includes a very easy custom MCV in JavaScript. As we've seen ealier this MCV catters for the default CRUD operations.
Most of the time those CRUD operations would be enough for your need. Now that we want to add a new operation to login. We need to extend Controller to do our cutom ajax call. If we want to add data to the model (like let's say the firstname of the user logged)
we need to extend Model.
```

If you run your app in step9_todo, you get a new login page but on login, you bump into 500. Your turn to fix that...
### 3. Your TODO
#### TODO 1: Generate User and UserRole
run 

```java
grails s2-quickstart threecircles User Role
```
when prompted to overwrite User, answer yes, but once User is generated add back those fields:
```java
 String firstname
 String lastname
 static hasMany = [friends:User]
```

See [Spring Security plugin documentation page](http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core) for more details.
#### TODO 2: Adding @Secure
In CheckinController.groovy, 
- add annotation at class level with IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED rule. 
- inject spring security service
See [Peter simplified spring source with Grails blog post] (http://blog.springsource.com/2010/08/11/simplified-spring-security-with-grails/) for more details.

#### TODO 3: Only my friends checkins in my timeline
- in login method: get user from params 
- if user not found or wrong password send error message
- if user found and password ok retrun all my checkins plus the one from my friends

#### TODO 4: Boostrap revisited
In Boostrap.groovy, register yourself with you name and password and add your friends too.

### 4. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step9_done
```

## Step10: Display my friends

### 1. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step10_todo
```
### 2. We've DONE it for you

### 3. your TODO
#### 3.1 Add sesssion
- in **CheckinController.groovy**, once logged store user insession
- in **UserController.groovy**, retrieve user and display only his friend to friend view.

### 4. Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step10_done
```

## Step11: In the Cloud
### Create a cloud foundry account
Sign up at [www.cloudfoundry.com](http://www.cloudfoundry.com)

### Config
Install cloud foundry plugin
```java
grails install-plugin cloud-foundry
```
Configure your global setting
```java
cd ~/.grails
touch settings.groovy
```
in settings.grrovy add your cloud foundry credentials
```
grails.plugin.cloudfoundry.username="..."
grails.plugin.cloudfoundry.password="..."
```
### Change your URL
in **configuration-bootstrap.js**, comment localhost URL, uncomment your cloud foundry one

Be creative and choose your own doamin name (we have already taken threecircles.cloudfoundry.com so do not try this one)
Change it here with fiverectangles.cloudfoundry.com or twobubbles.cloudfoundry.com, sixtriangles.cloudfoundry.com

```
threecircles.loadConfiguration = (function () {
    threecircles.configuration = {
        //baseURL: "http://localhost:8080/ThreeCircles/",
        //Uncomment before pushing to cloudfoundry
        baseURL: "http://ThreeCircles.cloudfoundry.com/",
        namespace: "threecircles",
        domain:[]
    };
})();
```
### Push to cloud foundry
Simply run the command
```
grails prod cf-push
```
When prompted for a domain name on cloudfoundry, use the one you choose just below.

## Step12: PhoneGap Build

### Configure your PhoneGap Build account
Sign up at [build.phonegap.com](http://build.phonegap.com)
### Config.groovy
```java
phonegapbuild.username="..."
phonegapbuild.password="..."
phonegapbuild.phonegapversion="2.3.0"
```

### Package you HTML and JS
Using [3musket33rs](http://3musket33rs.github.com/) PhoneGap Build plugin, simply go to
```java
http://localhost:8080/ThreeCircles/app/initBuild
```
Use the Push button and refresh from time to time. Once ready, use QRcode to download your app onto your phone on [PhoneGap build](http://build.phonegap.com)

## Step: Now Have FUN !!
